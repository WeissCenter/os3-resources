The following are the questions we look forward from learning from you during the breakout sessions.

### Tools and Technology.

2. What tools or technologies do IT teams use and support?
3. Do IT teams leverage any Cloud systems? 
4. If yes, what tools or services do they use?
5. Who would use the tool?
6. What permissions would they need?

### Unit Record or Aggregate Data.
1. Is there a workflow process to review and approve the data and reports before they are made available for public consumption?
2. “Unit record” versus “aggregate data”:
3. What level of data can be uploaded into the tool?
4. What controls or rules need to be applied before data and reports are published for public consumption?
5. What are potential challenges to getting the tool adopted in your State?
