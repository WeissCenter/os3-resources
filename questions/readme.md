# Breakout Sessions
The breakout sessions will give you the opportunity to have a smaller group discussion about how you source, define and report the IDEA data.

There will be three separate sessions where you can voice your needs and provide your feedback in a safe and respectful environment.

The following are the questions we look forward from learning from you during these breakout sessions.

- [Data Reporting](reporting.md)
- [Data Glossary](glossary.md)
- [Data Sourcing](sourcing.md)
